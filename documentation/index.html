            <p><b>Introduction to Music Theory</b></p>
            <p>Music theory is the study of the fundamental elements that form the foundation of music. It provides the tools for understanding how music is structured, composed, and performed.</p>
            
            <code>Key aspects of music theory includes:</code>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Rhythm</li>
                <li>Harmony</li>
                <li>Scales</li>
                <li>Chords</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Chords Progression</b></p>
            <p>A chord progression is a sequence of chords played in a specific order. Chord progressions form the harmonic backbone of a piece of music, guiding the movement and emotional direction of the song.</p>
            <p>Common chord progressions use the diatonic chords from a key, and they often revolve around tension (dominant chords) and resolution (tonic chords).</p>
            
            <code>Chord Progressions:</code>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I-IV-V-I:</strong> A common progression in classical and popular music.</li>
                <li><strong>ii-V-I:</strong> A common jazz progression.</li>
                <li><strong>I-V-vi-IV:</strong> A popular progression in pop and rock music.</li>
                <li><strong>vi-IV-I-V:</strong> Often used in modern pop ballads.</li>
                <li><strong>I-vi-ii-V:</strong> Classic doo-wop progression.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Family Chords</b></p>
            <p>Family chords are the set of diatonic chords that naturally occur within a particular key. These chords are built on each degree of the scale and are often referred to by Roman numerals.</p>
            
            <code>In any key, there are three main types of family chords:</code>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tonic:</strong> The home chord, representing and stability and resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Subdominant:</strong> Creates movement away from the tonic, including tension.</li>
                <li><strong>Dominant:</strong> Builds tension that leads back to tonic.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Modes and Scales</b></p>
            <p>A scale is a set of notes arranged in ascending or descending order, forming the basis of melodies and harmonies. The most common scales are the major and minor scales, which form the foundation of Western music. Each scale has seven degrees, and each degree can be the root of a chord.</p>
            <p>Modes are variations of scales that start on different degrees of the scale and create unique sounds or moods.</p>
            <code>There are seven modes in the diatonic system:</code>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Scale/ Ionian:</strong> Bright happy sound</li>
                <li><strong>Dorian:</strong> A minor-like sound with a raised sixth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phrygian:</strong> A darker, more exotic minor sound</li>
                <li><strong>Lydian:</strong> A major sound with a raised fourth, giving it a dreamy feel </li>
                <li><strong>Mixolydian:</strong> A major sound with a lowered seventh, often used in blues and rock</li>
                <li><strong>Aeolian/ Natural Minor Scale:</strong> Sad, melancholic sound</li>
                <li><strong>Locrian:</strong> A diminished and tense sound</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Circle of Fifths</b></p>
            <p>The circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationship between the 12 keys of the chromatic scale. It shows the progression of keys arranged by perfect fifth intervals.</p>
            <p>Starting from C major, each step clockwise moves up by a perfect fifth (C-G-D-A-E...), while moving counterclockwise steps down by a perfect fourth.</p>
            
            <code>The circle of fifths is useful for:</code>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding key signatures</li>
                <li>Modulation</li>
                <li>Building Chords Progression</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By mastering the circle of fifths, musicians can better navigate key changes, compose music, and create harmonic tension and resolution.</p>
