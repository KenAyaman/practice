                <p><b>Isaac Newton</b> (1642-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, and author. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. Newton's work in physics laid the foundation for classical mechanics, and his laws of motion are still taught in schools today.</p>
                <p>Newton's most notable contributions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Laws of Motion:</b> Newton formulated three fundamental laws of motion that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it.</li>
                    <li><b>Law of Universal Gravitation:</b> He proposed that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe, which helped explain planetary motions and the orbits of celestial bodies.</li>
                    <li><b>Calculus:</b> Independently of Leibniz, Newton developed the foundations of calculus, providing essential tools for mathematics and physics.</li>
                    <li><b>Optics:</b> His experiments with prisms led to the understanding that white light is composed of different colors, establishing the basis for modern optics.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to his scientific achievements, Newton served as the president of the Royal Society and was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705. He spent his later years at the University of Cambridge, where he also held the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.</p>
                <p>Newton's legacy continues to influence countless fields, from physics to engineering. His contributions have paved the way for modern scientific inquiry and discovery.</p>
